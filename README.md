# Game.tv

Inside the src/test/main folder I have defined a package that will hold the base class for performing different operations like launching mobile app, clicking on the link to login,etc.
In the pom.xml file we will be specifying the depdendencies required for running the project like appium, testng, selenium,etc.
Test cases would ideally be placed under the src/test/java folder inside a separate package.
There is a separate folder (Maven Dependencies) that gets created and all the required jars will automatically gets added to it when we save pom.xml file.
